# Cloudmesh Vagrant: New

[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) is a open-source software that
help you to build and manage virtual machines through command line
interface. `cm4`provides you with an easy wahy to manage multiple
virtual machines via vagrnt.


This is interesting and we need to compare this with the Vagrantfile
approach I use that is stored in a directory for each vm

Thanks to the
"entry_points" functionality supported by
[setuptools](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools), we can easily use
this script as if it is a "real" command line application.
It enables you to execute
the same job on multiple Vagrant instances at the same time,
including:

- transfer file and folder between host machine and instances
- execute command or script on instances.

This allows you to test a program on multiple virtual machines, which
may have different OS and working environment, at the same time, by
just issuing a **single** command.

## Setup Walkthrough

### Requirement summary

You will need the following

- Python 3 and `pip`.
- [virtualization provider](#Install-*virtualization-provider*).
- `scp`

### Install vagrant

You can download Vagrant from
[here](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html). It supports all
mainstream operating system, including Windows, Mac OS, and various
Linux distribution. After finishing installation, you can check if the
installation success by executing `vagrant version`. 

### Install *virtualization provider*

Although Vagrant *help* you with managing virtual machines, Vagrant
itself does not *handle* the task of virtualization. Vagrant relies on
virtualization software or even cloud service provider to do the
actual work of *virtualization* -- running virtual machine on top of
host machine, provisioning computational and storage resources to
virtual machines, communicating between host and virtual
machine....etc. In other word, to leverage Vagrant functionality**,
you need to install Vagrant along with *virtualization provider*
and/or the correspondent t *Vagrant plugin*** that enables Vagrant to
interact with virtualization provider.

The default virtualization provider of Vagrant is
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). You don't have to install
any plugin to let Vagrant working with VirtualBox. However, you indeed
need to install VirtualBox if it don't exist on your host computer. In
this case please refer to
[VirtualBox downloand page](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). Also,
please note that using VirtualBox as the virtualization provider
implies virtual machines will run on your host machine. So make sure
there are sufficient resources on your host machine.

You may choose other virtualization provider. In this case, please
setup virtualization provider of your choice and follow the
[Vagrant user manual]('https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/providers/') to
setup Vagrant with correspondent plugin. If there is no special need
that you have to address, we strongly recommend you just go with
VirtualBox.

### Configure `Vagrantfile`

`Vagrantfile` is the main configuration file of Vagrant. Vagrant will
only interact with the virtual machines defined in the `Vagrantfile`.

In `cloudmesh`, your
`VAGRANTFILE_PATH` will be changed to
`~/.cloudmesh/vagrant_workspace/Vagrantfile`.

`cm4 vagrant` will try to locate `Vagrantfile` every time it invokes. If
it can't find it, a default `Vagrantfile`at
default path. Default `Vagrantfile` defines two Ubuntu machine called
`node1` and `node2`, powered by VirtualBox.

BUG: THIS DOES NOT MAKE SENSE

You can use  [vagrant create](#create-instances) functionality to
easily setup a `Vagrantfile` which defines any amount of virtual
machine as you want. Moreover,  you can also try to customize your own
`Vagrantfile`. Please refer to
[Vagrant user manual](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/vagrantfile/) to
see how to do that. Don't forget that currently `ehvagrant` just
supports Unix-like OS, and after finishing your modification on
`Vagrantfile`, save it at `VAGRANTFILE_PATH`.

 The following walkthrough assumes you go with the generated default
`Vagrantfile`.

### Initialize virtual machine

After finishing `Vagrantfile`definition, you are now ready to deploy
and run your virtual machine with Vagrant. But first, let us check
current status of your Vagrant provider. Execute `cm4 vm list`

BUG: IMAGE PROKEN, COPY ASCII

![before_init](../../documentation/source/img/vagrant/before_init.png)

Then execute `cm4 start`. Since your machines are not deployed
yet, Vagrant will first deploy your machines and then bring them up,
and automatically do LOTS of setting. When Vagrant has done its work,
we can confirm this by issuing `cm4 vm list` again. You will see now:

BUG: IMAGE PROKEN, COPY ASCII

![after_init](../../documentation/source/img/vagrant/after_init.png)

HOO-WA! Your two virtual machines are painlessly deployed, configured,
up and running! 

### Micellouenes: setup `scp` on host machine

Since these topics are not directly relate to `cm4`, here I just
describe how do you check these functionally are working properly.

For `scp`, open terminal and execute `scp`, you should see a short
usage guide shows on your screen. If it is not there, please install
`scp` and make sure its executive file is in your `PATH` environment
variable.

## Usage

### Introduction

#### Which instances will be affected by my command?

Commands will only affect the instances that belongs to *current
Vagrant environment*, which is defined by the `Vagrantfile` locates at
`VAGRNANTFILE_PATH`. Instances are identified by its name.

#### How to specify instances I want to work with?

Use`--vms=<vmList>` option to specify which instances you want to work
with. Your `<vmList>` string will be parsed by
[python-hostlist](https://www.nsc.liu.se/~kent/python-hostlist/)
package. Here are some example how your `<vmList>` string will be
parsed:

```
>>> hostlist.expand_hostlist('a,b,c')  # --vms=a,b,c
['a', 'b', 'c']

>>> hostlist.expand_hostlist('node[1-5]') # --vms=node[1-5]
['node1', 'node2', 'node3', 'node4', 'node5']
```

Most of commands can work without `--vms`. But Be careful, issuing a
command without specifying instances will usually affect **all** of
the instances that are available in the current vagrant environment.

#### Before Start

Before transferring file and folder between host and instances or
running commands and scripts on instances, you must **make sure** that
all of the instances you want to work with are **up, running, and
reachable through network.**

### Manage instances

#### create instances

Usage: `python vagrant.py vagrant create --vms=<vmList> [--image=IMAGE] [--output=OUTPUT] `

Generate a `Vagrantfile` that defines multiple instances. **This
functionality can only define instances working with VirtualBox**.

You should use `--vms=<vmList>` argument to specify the list of names
of instances. See
[here](#How-to-specify-instances-I-want-to-work-with?) to know how to.

If you don't specify an `IMAGE`, `cm4` will use
[Ubuntu/xenial64](https://app.vagrantup.com/ubuntu/boxes/xenial64) as
its default image. If you specify an `IMAGE` that is in the list given
by `vagrant box list` command, Vagrant will define instances using
local image. Otherwise, it will try to search
[Vagrant Cloud](https://app.vagrantup.com/boxes/search) and download
the image.

Use `--output` argument to specify the output path of generated
`Vagrantfile`. If you don't specify `--output` path, generated
`Vagrantfile` will be save to `vagrantFILE_PATH` **and replace
original file saved in there**.

#### start up instances

Usage: `python vagrant.py vagrant start [--vms=<vmList>]`

Start up stopped or suspended instances.

#### resume instances

Usage: `python vagrant.py vagrant resume [--vms=<vmList>]`

resume suspended instances.

#### stop instances

Usage: `python vagrant.py vagrant stop [--vms=<vmList>]`

Shut down instances. Any unsaved data will be lost. 

#### suspend instance

Usage: `python vagrant.py vagrant suspend [--vms=<vmList>]`

Save current state of instances and then stop it. Unsaved data will
not lost and user can restore the current state and continue to work
latter on.

#### destroy instances

Usage:```python vagrant.py vagrant destroy [--vms=<vmList>]```

Destroy Vagrant instances. The data stored on the instance will be lost.

#### show current status of instances

Usage: `python vagrant.py vagrant ls`

Show the status of all Vagrant instances belonging to the current environment. 

#### show current status of specific instance

Usage: `python vagrant.py vagrant info Name` 

Show the status of instance specified by `Name`.

###  Transfer file and folder between host and instances

- The following functionality are implemented by utilizing `scp `
   command.
   [As previously mentioned](#Micellouenes:-setup-python-3-and-`scp`-on-host-machine),
   please make sure `scp` functionality is available on your host
   machine.
- If you specify a folder as the target to be uploaded/downloaded, all
   of its contents will be get uploaded/downloaded.
- **To specify a folder, just put a `/` in the end of the path
   string**. For example, `A/smaple/folder/string/`; Or use `-r` flag to
   indicates the target is a folder.

#### upload file or folder (from host to instances)

Usage:`python vagrant.py vagrant upload --from FROM --to TO [-r] [--vms=<vmlist>]`

Upload file or folder on host machine to instances.

#### download file or folder (from instances to host)

Usage:`python vagrant.py vagrant download --from FROM --to TO [-r] [--vms=<vmlist>]`

If you are trying to download file or folder from two or more
instances simultaneously, data will be parallelly downloaded and be
separately stored in a folder which name after the instances'`name` .

For example, if user try to download `~/foo.txt` simultaneously from
`node1` and `node2`, and designate `./bar/foo.txt` as the host file
path, then `cm4` will automatically modify the host file path,
copy `~/foo.txt` on `node1` into `./bar/node1/foo.txt` and copy
`~foo.txt`on `node2` into `./bar/node2/foo.txt`.

### Execute arbitrary shell command or script on instances

#### start a ssh session

Usage: `python vagrant.py vagrant ssh NAME`

Launch a secure-shell session which connects to the vagrant instance specified by ```NAME```.

#### run arbitrary shell command

Usage:```python vagrant.py vagrant run command COMMAND [--vms=<vmList>]```

Run an arbitrary shell `COMMAND` on instances. If user specify
multiple instances to run, the command will run on those instances
simultaneously, i.e., in a parallel fashion. Any output produced to
the `stdout` and `stderr` of executing instances will be fetched and
reformatted to a job report. Finally, the job report will print out to
the current terminal.

![run_command_example](../../documentation/source/img/vagrant/run_command.png)

#### run arbitrary shell script

Usage: ```python vagrant.py vagrant run script SCRIPT [--data=PATH] [--vms=<vmList>]```

Run an arbitrary **shell script** on instances. The behavior of this
command will comply with `run command`, plus extra features defined as
following:

* positional argument `SCRIPT` is the path of the script file to be
  executed, which must locates on the host machine. It will be uploaded
  and stored at the `JOB_FOLDER` of all executing instances, which
  locates at` ~/cm_experiment/{script_name}_{epoch_second}/`.

* If there is any data that must be run against the script, specify
  the path of the data with `--data` argument. **If you specify a folder
  in `--data`, you must put `/` in the end of folder path**. The data 
  will be copied into `$JOB_FOLDER/data/` directory of all executing
  instances.

* About the script and its execution:

  * If the script will ever produce any output file, it should be
    stored at `$JOB_FOLDER/output/` directory. The behavior including
    building the `$JOB_FOLDER/output/` folder and storing result file to
    that folder **should be handle by the script itself**.
  
  * When execution, the script will always receive the value of
    `JOB_FOLDER` as its first argument. This value can be used in
    various ways. For example, to build the `$JOB_FOLDER/output/`
    folder.
	
* After execution, if there exist anything in ` $JOB_FOLDER$/output/`,
  then it will all be fetched and stored to  `~/experiment/{instnace_name}/{script_name}_{epoch_second}/output/` folder on the host machine. 
  
  * If using with `cloudmesh`, output content will be stored at `~/.cloudmesh/experiment/{instnace_name}/{script_name}_{epoch_second}/output/`. 

* Finally, execution reports will be printed out to current terminal.
