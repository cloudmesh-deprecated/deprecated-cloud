# VM Providers (outdated)

Cm4 works straight forward with a number of providers under the
assumption you have accounts on these frameworks. We demonstrate hete
how to start a singel vm on each of these providers and list the
started vms. Defaults form the configuration file are used to select
images and flavors. These defaults can naturally be changed.

## General Cloud Providers Access

We are using the python library
[Apache Libcloud](https://libcloud.apache.org) to interact with
cloud service providers. Currently, in `cms`, we could access:

* [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com)
* [AZURE](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)
* any cloud service providers using *OpenStack*.
  For example, [Chameleon](https://www.chameleoncloud.org) and 
  [Jetstream](https://jetstream-cloud.org)

By using the *Apache Libcloud* API, we could do these operations for
nodes in above cloud service providers:

* Start the node
* Stop the node
* Resume the node
* Suspend the node
* Destory the node
* Create the node

**Improvement**: Sometimes adjustments to nodes are necessary (switch
between different images/OS and service sizes).  Cm4 also allow users
to customize their instances across multiple providers by using
refactor functions to support their management tasks.

* Resize the node
* Rebuild(with different image) the node
* Rename the node
* Revert previous operations to the node


## General Interface

```bash
$ cms set cloud=<cloudname as defined in the ~/.cloudmesh/cloudmesh.yaml>
$ cms vm start
$ cms vm list

$ cms flavor="medium"
$ cms image="ubuntu18.04"

$ cms vm start
```

## Explicit Use with Options

```bash
$ cms vm start --cloud=chameleon --image=ubuntu18.04 --flavor=medium --key=~/.ssh/id_rsa.bub
```




## Vagrant

TODO

```bash
$ cms set cloud=vagrant
$ cms vm start
$ cms vm list
```

## AWS

### Setup and Configuration

Amazon Web Service (**AWS**) provided by Amazon is a secure cloud
service platform, users could start any instances with selected
images.

Before users use the **cms** platform to access **EC2**, they have to finish these preparations:

1. EC2 account, more information is 
   [here](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/)

2. Log in the EC2 account, update your **Access Key**.

   **Access Keys** has two parts: **Access Key ID** and **Secret
   Access Key**. These **Access Keys** are the only way you could
   authentically access the AWS though AWS API requests.  (create new
   Access Key: Account (right upper corner) > My Security Credentials
   > Access Keys > Create New Access Key)

3. **Private Key file** is a key pairs to encrypt and decrypt login
   information. While using **Private Key file**, there is no need to
   use username or password to login the instance of AWS. For sshing
   the instance, the ssh client would use the **private key file**
   instead of credential information. (create new key pairs: Network &
   Security (left column bar) > Key Pairs > Create Key Pair)

4. **Security Group** acts as a virtual firewall for the instance.
   When you launch a instance, we have to attach the **Security
   Group** to it for controlling the traffic in and out. So before you
   are using any nodes in AWS, you have to pre-define the **Security
   Group** that you will use.  (create new Security Group: Network $
   Security (left column bar) > Security Group > Create Security
   Group)

5. **Region** is the service location where you start the instance.
   AWS hosts services in different regions, you should select the
   region where you want to start you instance.

When you finish all above things, you should update information into
the block 'aws' of **cloudmesh.yaml** file in **ETC** folder

**EC2** provides On-Demand Pricing cloud services based on different
CPU, Memory and Storage selections. Please visit this
[page](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/) for more
information. In default setting, we use the latest **Ubuntu** image
filled in default.image field. If you want to use other images, please
update the Image ID into it.


```bash
$ cms set cloud=aws
$ cms vm start
$ cms vm list
```

## Azure


Uses [LibCloud's Azure ARM Compute Driver](https://libcloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/compute/drivers/azure_arm.html)

### Setup and Configuration


**Install Azure CLI**

[Download and install according to your platform.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)

**Make sure subscription is registered for compute services**

```
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.Compute
```

**Service principal**

[Full documentation on creating service principals.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)
The Azure ARM Driver does not appear to support certificate based
principals at this time.


Create Principal

```
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name cm-admin-pw --password <SECRET>
```

Add `Owner` role.

```
az role assignment create --assignee <APP_ID> --role Owner
```

*Note:* `<APP_ID>` is provided in the output when the principal is created


```bash
$ cms set cloud=azure
$ cms vm start
$ cms vm list
```

## OpenStack

OpenStack is an Infrastructure service that allows users to utilize
computing resource in cloud service platform through virtual
environments.

[Chameleon Cloud](https://www.chameleoncloud.org/) provides an
OpenStack installation of version 2015.1 (Kilo) using the KVM
virtualization technology at the KVM@TACC site. It is important to
make sure you are visiting the
[KVM@TACC](https://openstack.tacc.chameleoncloud.org/) site so as to
get proper installation. Learn more
[here](https://chameleoncloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/technical/kvm.html)
to properly set up yout account before proceed to your journey with
**cms**.
